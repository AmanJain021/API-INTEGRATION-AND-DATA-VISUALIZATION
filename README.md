This project demonstrates the comprehensive implementation of API integration and data visualization using Python. Its core objective is to fetch real-time weather and forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap public API and present this information through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. By leveraging the capabilities of Python and several of its powerful libraries, the project enables users to explore and understand weather conditions in any given city with ease. The application primarily utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the required data in JSON format. Once the data is fetched, it is processed using pandas, a robust library that simplifies data manipulation and analysis. For visualization, the application incorporates both matplotlib and seaborn, which are widely used for plotting data in an informative and visually appealing manner.The interactive user interface is built using Streamlit, a Python framework designed for creating web apps with minimal effort. Streamlit enables developers to construct dynamic dashboards with elements like dropdowns, sliders, toggles, and checkboxes, making the app highly customizable and responsive. In this dashboard, users can input a city name and view various weather metrics such as current temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, along with a 5-day forecast. The toggles allow users to selectively display specific types of data according to their interest. Forecast data is represented through line plots and other chart types, offering a clear picture of weather trends over time.The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the code editor, and the Python version used during development was 3.13.5. A virtual environment is recommended for managing dependencies to ensure consistency across different systems. Streamlit runs the application locally on a web server, which users can access through their web browser in real-time. This feature makes it an excellent choice for lightweight, responsive data apps without the overhead of traditional web development frameworks.From a practical perspective, this type of project has multiple real-world applications. It can be used to build public weather information portals, integrated into smart home dashboards, or even paired with IoT devices for real-time environmental monitoring. It also serves as a solid learning project for students and early-career developers to understand how to interact with external APIs, clean and process data, and build interactive data-driven applications. Additionally, the project structure is modular and adaptable â€” by simply modifying the API source and data parameters, it can be transformed to visualize financial market trends, COVID-19 statistics, air quality indices, and more.The final deliverables for this task include a fully functional Python script (app.py), a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies. Overall, this project highlights the synergy between real-time data and interactive design, showcasing how meaningful insights can be extracted and delivered to users in an accessible and visually compelling format. It represents a practical and extensible solution for data-centric applications in both academic and professional settings.
